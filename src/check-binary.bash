#   If more than one binary is looked for, output the first found binary
#   absolute path and exit without error.
#
# @example
#   source "${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}/libs/biapy-bashlings/src/check-binary.bash"
#   check-binary "wget;curl" "wget" >'/dev/null' || exit 1
#
# @arg $1 string A semicolon separated list of binary names.
# @arg $2 string The binary's package name.
#
# @stdout The first found binary absolute path, as outputed by `command -v`.
# @stderr An colored error message recommending the installation of $2 package.
#
# @see cecho
#
# @exitcode 0 If binary is found in PATH.
# @exitcode 1 If binary is not found in PATH.
